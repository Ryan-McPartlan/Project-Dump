RPS RPG is my first ever coding project, which I made... long before I knew how to program.
Since I went in basically only knowing how to use variebles, if/elif/else, and some I/O stuff,
and didn't know how to make loops or functions, you need to run the code again for each "turn"

The reason the format is so messed up is I had the code saved in a Facebook Note document from 3 years ago 
(Oh how far ive come) and it messed up the syntax. Basically the way I get it to copy paste it into
http://labs.codecademy.com/#:workspace and use the little white box to run it over and over.

For inputs, when the text boxes pop up, fill in a uppercase word. Sometimes you will have to figure out the
possible inputs or secret inputs based on clues.

Regardless of all of its failings, This project is very near and dear to my heart and I will love it forever.
